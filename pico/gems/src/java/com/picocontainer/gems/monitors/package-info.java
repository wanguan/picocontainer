/**
 * This package contains various implementations of the {@link com.picocontainer.ComponentMonitor}
 * interface that extend the capabilities supplied by the default PicoContainer.
 * Most Monitors rely on one or more 3rd party libraries to perform their job,
 * however, they are independent and you only need to import the library associated
 * with the monitor you desire to utilize.
 * <h4>Logging Monitors</h4>

 * <ul>
 * 	<li><a href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/">Apache Commons Logging</a>:

 * 	<li><a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">Apache Log4j</a>:
